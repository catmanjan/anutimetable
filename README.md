### 2017-01-24
* Fixed an issue with scraper generating wrong iid

### 2016-02-04

  * No UI for now, use Magic.cast() in console to see effects.
  * The result will be ordered by clashes in ascending order.

### 2016-01-28
* Temporarily fixed the problem with choosable compulsory courses.
  * It will be deprecated soon.

### 2016-01-18
* Fixed the problem with confirm window popping out while clicking re-choose buttons.
* Added border spacing.

### 2016-01-16
* Compressed JSON structure.
  * `day` will now be index instead of string.
  * Removed `name` because it's redundant.
  * Added `id`.
* Added tutorial re-choose feature (appeared as icons).
* Added pinned classes icon effect.
* Added confirm window when deleting courses.
* Added `revisionNum`.
  * If a new value is found, then clear tutorials.
  * **This value is only changed when changing data structure!**
* Added mouseover effects when you hover a choosable tutorial.
  * The purpose of this is to ease the pain of finding same tutorials with different time.
* Changed `delete` button next to course name to icons.
* Changed the behaviour of tutorial displaying.
  * It will now automatically add newly updated classes to the cookie/localStorage instead of ignoring its existence.
  * After choosing a tutorial, the element will be deleted instead of set to hidden.
  * The `choose` button will now longer appear if there's a chosen tutorial.
  * Because of the order changing after re-choose tuts, lesson style will now determined by the existence of lesson-style-x, instead of hash.
* Changed the way of deciding how different groups belong to one tutorial.
  * The normal format of a class name is: `{COURSE_NAME}{GROUP_TYPE}{GROUP_NUMBER}/ {NUMBER}`, {NUMBER} will be used.
* Changed the structure of Course.structure (`{ class: chosen tutorial id, ... }`).
* Changed weekdays header to full.
* Removed leading zeros in `item.info` and ending `/`s (because the official data sometimes mistakenly gives different numbers such as `01` and `1`).
* Removed usage of `data-fgroup`, `data-id` will now be used.
* Fixed a bug where when creating an empty timeslot, it will clone the lesson style class as well.

### 2016-01-11
* Style changes to save vertical real estate.
* Made lesson style fit to whole block.
* Fixed the issue where the color remains when a class is removed.
* Removed animations.

### 2016-01-06
* Fixed an issue with colspan.
* Cleared redundant code.

### 2015-12-21
* Fixed course deletion animation (slideDown() -> slideUp()).
* Fixed pressing enter will not add a course issue under some browsers (event.which is not supported).

### 2015-12-19
* Rewrote the code related to :30 courses support.
  * Instead of remove unused cells, it will now just hide them, this makes searching much easier.
  * It's now fully functional and the code is much cleaner than the previous version.
  * **There should be no broken table if used proper, but if it occurs, please submit an issue with a screeshot and the course addition/deletion order.**
* 'class' label is now treated as 'non-compulsory' category and is selectable between different ones.
* Added one more color to make sure six courses all get a different widget color.
* Replaced the text 'Updated for 2016.' with default timetable update time.
* Changed the table to show borders since it's hard to see which timeslot section the class belongs to without them
  * If we set the lesson block to inherit the cell height (cell height 1px and lesson block height 100%), it'll cause some issues when adding/deleting classes, even not, it shows too much space and looks weird).

### 2015-12-15
* Added maximum 6 courses adding limitation.
  * Code is messy, will need to rewrite it someday.
  * If the table displays in an abnormal way, submit an issue with a screeshot and the course addition/deletion order.
* Added :30 courses supports.
* Changed the structure for JSON (**Note that the old JSON will no longer work!**).
  * Removed key 'hour', added key 'start', altered key from 'duration' to 'dur'.
  * Combined all identical data classes.
  * Size reduced by 50%.

### 2015-12-09
* Deprecated save & flush button, these operations will now be processed automatically. <issue #26>
* Reconstructed functions & variables into OOP style.
  * Not sure why 'this' keyword sometimes not working so using the direct name (e.g. Course.display()) instead for now.
* Made the load JSON button only visible when the online source is not accessible. <issue #27>
* Made the auto-complete more smarter. <issue #29, #31>
  * It'll now order by matching relevance.
  * The name will be more readable.
  * Course addition will be now ignore everything after the dash, instead of underscore.
* Changed the structure for JSON (**Note that the old JSON will no longer work!**).
  * The structure will now be: [[fullName], [info], [location], [course]].
  * Removed key 'fullName', added key 'nid', 'iid' and 'lid' in course object.
  * This provides an index searching for fullName, location and info, which reduces the size of the data by about 50%.
  * The structure will change again in the upcoming days to merge same classes together and suit :30 classes. The file size will be significantly reduced.

### 2015-12-08
* Added delete, clear, save and flush feature (use localStorage / cookie depends on the availability).
* Fixed an issue with tutorial selection (explained in master upstream branch issue #22).
* Fixed the issue with not being able to choose between one hour tutorials.
* Fixed the issue with ics export will include all the tutorials regardless of choosing or not.
* Categorized files into folders (js, css and data, all json files will be saved in data).
* Added auto-complete feature.
  * For matching, if the user is using his/her/theirs own data without fullName field, then it'll use name instead.
* Added a spider written in jQuery.
  * Usage: Go to the pre-course-selection page, execute the code in a console or inline javascript: link.
  * Will retrieve validation data automatically, no need to input by yourself.
  * Appends an extra field 'fullName' to the data, which denotes the human readable name of the course (for use of auto-complete).
  * When executing, it'll display a mini progress box in the middle of the page.
  * This will fix the issue #22 without using a new identifier.

### 2015-12-06
* The scraper is planned for deletion.
* Instead, use the converter on the direct data source http://udsttweb99.anu.edu.au/Timetable2015/Timetable.csv (hopefully this will be updated by ANU for 2016)

### 2015-12-05
* 2016 draft timetable available.
* Added load json feature, supports local/offline (i.e. protocol file://, not local server) use.
* Fixed the /timetable.json relative path issue (was directing to the root directory).
* Changed the ics import button location and color.

### Known issues
* After deleting a course located at a index other than the last index, if the current index column is all empty, it won't delete this unused index column, which will cause a redundant gap column, but it'll be re-indexed after refreshing.
* When there is only one class for a certain group left, the choose button shouldn't be visible.
